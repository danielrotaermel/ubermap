# Example Configs	

## Usage

Feel free to change them to your liking.

### Installation

1. Copy the configs(*.cfg) you want to use from ```ubermap/Example\ Configs/Device ``` to ``` ~/Ubermap/Devices```

2. Copy the respective defaults from ```ubermap/Example\ Configs/Defaults``` to your Ableton User Library  ```<your-user-library>/Defaults/`` `

   > Don't copy the whole 'Defaults' folder, only the device folders that contain a file called 'Default.appc' else you might loose your already made custom Ableton defaults.
   >
   > Also if there are no defaults for the config you want to use there is no need to worry.
